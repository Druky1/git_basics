# GitHub_Markdown
 GitHub uses a syntax called **Markdown** to help you add basic text formatting to Issues, Pull Requests and files with `.md` extension.

 # Commonly Used Markdown Syntax
 
 ## # Header
 The `#` indicates a Header. `#` = Header1 and `##` = Header2

 ## * List Item 
 A single `*` or `-` followed by a space will create bulleted list.

 ## ** Bold Item ** 
 Two asterisks `**` on either side of string will make that text bold.

 ## - [ ] Checklist
 A  `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.

 ## @mention
 When you `@mention` someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.

 ## #975
A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.

Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji ID with `:`.
