git init ---  "initialize the repository"

git add anyfile.txt --- # stage a specific file

git add . --- "track changes for current and upcoming commits for all files"

git commit -m 'message of the commit' --- "snapshot of the changes and captures them since last commit"

git push -u origin main --- "send your local files to remote repository by associating local branch with the remote branch"
                        --- "where origin means the default name for the remote repository created and main as the name of the branch."

The '-u' {--set-upstream} flag is setting up a tracking relationship between local "main" branch and the remote "main" branch on "origin".
This allows you to simply use 'git pull' or 'git push' without specifiying the remote and branch each time, as Git remembers the upstream branch.

git branch --- "Shows all the branches available"

git branch "branchName" --- "Creates a branch"

git checkout "branchName" --- "Switch branches"

git checkout -b "branchName" --- "Combine the creating and switching branches"

git pull --- " fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch"

git push --- "pushes your local commits to the remote repository"

git merge "branchName" --- "Merges changes from one branch into the current branch"

git status --- "shows the status of working directory"
